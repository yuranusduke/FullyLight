# FullyLight
FullyLight: Keras-like Neural Network Classifier

Pure R implementation of fully-connected NN for classification.

One may have to go to `package` folder and in `FLpkg_script.R`, one may change directory and run the script to build 
package, since I have not submitted to CRAN, you have to do it manually.
After that, it's easy to run `library(FullyLight)`.

And you may also have to install some dependencies beforehand. 

In `code/app/app.R`, you may run it directly, and play with it.
